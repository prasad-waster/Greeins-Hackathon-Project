## 🚀 Key Features

- 📸 **Image-Based Growth Analysis**:
  - Upload plant images across weeks (e.g., Week 1 vs Week 2)
  - AI estimates growth percentage based on:
    - Height
    - Leaf count
    - Leaf area and color quality

- 🧠 **Disease Detection**:
  - Integrated ML model identifies common plant diseases from uploaded images
  - Displays probable disease names and visual cues

- 💡 **Smart Care Tips**:
  - Watering schedules
  - Fertilizer suggestions
  - Sunlight needs — based on plant condition

- 📊 **Visualization**:
  - Simple graphs showing growth trends
  - Visual indicators of health/disease over time

- 🌐 **Fully Frontend-Based**:
  - Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
  - ML models run in-browser (using TensorFlow.js or integrated Python-in-the-browser tools)
